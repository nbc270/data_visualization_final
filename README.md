Here is my final project for the data visualization course I took this summer. I rendered my viz' in jupyter notebook using folium (leaflet backend) and plotly. Unforutnately the HTML attached for the two folium viz csnnot be rendered in github as they're too big. The plotly one (challenge_4.html) does work, as seen [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nbc270/data_visualization_final/blob/master/challenge_4.html). In the end my viz can be seen [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nbc270/data_visualization_final/blob/master/data_viz_final_project_images.ipynb) in case the notebook doesn't render in Github. The buttons for the first viz do not show the fast backward, backward, forward, or fast forward buttons but they work in the order described from top to bottom. Also feel free to clone this repo and run the notebook for thre best way to see all visualizations.
